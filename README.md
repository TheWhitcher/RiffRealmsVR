# RiffRealmsVR - A Rifftastic Adventure in Virtual Reality

Welcome to RiffRealmsVR, a captivating virtual reality experience that transports you into the role of an Astro-Rifter on an extraordinary musical journey through fantasy realms. Developed as a semester-long project by a small group of 3rd-year college students, RiffRealmsVR stands at the intersection of innovation, creativity, and immersive gameplay.

## Special Note

This project emerged from an assignment challenging us to incorporate both hardware and software components. In response, we crafted a 3D VR game in Unity, pushing our boundaries beyond the familiar realm of 2D Unity projects. As a hardware component, we engineered a custom controller, seamlessly connecting with the VR headset to elevate the gameplay experience.

## Unleash the Power of Music

Your mission in RiffRealmsVR is to travel to fantasy realms, each brimming with unique environments and enchanting melodies. As you traverse through dimensions, you'll rock out to the songs of the land.

Immerse yourself in this musical odyssey, where the fusion of technology and creativity invites you to embark on an unforgettable journey. Put on your VR headset, connect your custom guitar, and get ready to rock the realms!

*Note: The project currently supports a Windows build, and while we encountered a challenge with Oculus's OS, we aim to address this issue in future updates.*
